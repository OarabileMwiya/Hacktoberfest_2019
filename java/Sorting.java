/*
    A Generics JAVA class providing a few algorithms for sorting.
    
    Code that uses generics has many benefits over non-generic code:
    Stronger type checks at compile time.
    A Java compiler applies strong type checking to generic code and issues errors if the code violates type safety. 
    Fixing compile-time errors is easier than fixing runtime errors, which can be difficult to find.
